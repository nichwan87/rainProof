## rainProof
An app that assists users find events, concerts and entertainment schedules. 
The app will pin-point event locations and can have events filtered by date and state of Australia.
This app allows users to be 'RainProof' so that RainChecks are not needed when planning outings.
Links to the payment pages to book the viewable events will be provided if the user selects an event.

# Support
Please contact Will, Dinh or Nicholas for any support related enquiries.

# Roadmap
Future updates will include having browser back buttons work to move between the event description and the events overview.
The 'next' button in the events overview section will be worked on to only scroll forward if further events are scheduled for the selected date.
